I am an undergrad studying Mathematics of Computation at University of
California, Los Angeles. I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant solutions
in both Math and CS. Check out some of my [projects](/projects) for more
details.

This year, I'm working at the
[UCLA Cardiac Arrhythmia Center](https://www.uclahealth.org/locations/cardiac-arrhythmia-center),
studying the applications of Machine Learning to heart Rythym analysis, through
techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Networks, in
Python.

I am also currently the Research Head for
[DataRes at UCLA](https://ucladatares.com/), where I lead a small team of
passionate undergraduates interested in Machine Learning research, helping to
orchestrate their projects. For instance, this quarter, our theme is Geometric
Deep Learning, while last quarter, we looked at applications of Transformer
models for Time Series data.

Outside of academics, I am the Practice Coordinator for the UCLA Sailing Team. I also
enjoying baking, photography (check back here later if you want to see some
of my photos!), and exporing the outdoors, as much as I can in LA ;).
